1. Aspects of the work correctly and incorrectly implemented.
    a. It seems that everything is correctly implemented except for two things that I am a bit unsure about.
    I am not sure that I have everything posted to my CS account. I kept running into the error that the file index.html didn't exist. Additionally, some of the styling on my pages didn't follow through
    onto the actual page, despite the fact that everything seemed to be linked as it was shown in class. Other than this
    I believe that everything else is working correctly. 

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
    a. I attended office hours because I was confused on certain aspects of the assignment. However, other than these office hours, I did not discuss the assignment
    with anyone else. 

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
    a. Approximately 3-4 hours.
